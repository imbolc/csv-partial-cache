100,Continue,"Status code 100 Continue tells you that a part of the request has been received without any problems. At this point everything is OK but is still in process. If the remaining part of the request is not rejected, the server will send a final response once the request has been completed. If the HTTP headers had been rejected, this ensures that the client does not send a request for the body. However, if the request did not contain a header field, then the browser will simply ignore the response. See RFC7231, Section 6.2.1 for more information."
101,Switching Protocols,"There have been many HTTP protocols created since the Internetâ€™s humble beginnings. The first documented version of the HTTP protocol was HTTP 0.9. The current iteration is HTTP 2.0 or HTTP/2. Status code 101 Switching Protocols indicates that the server accepts the request from the client to switch to a different HTTP protocol through the Upgrade header field. When a browser makes a request for a page, it might receive the HTTP status code 101 and then the Upgrade header, which indicates the sever is switching to a different HTTP version. Finally, the assumption is that the server will agree to switch protocols only when it is beneficial, like upgrading/switching to a newer protocol versus an older one. See RFC7231, Section 6.2.2 for more information."
